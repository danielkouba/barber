HEADER:
- Can we move razor logo more to left at the top and make both logo and font size for sections (ABOUT, BARBERS etc) larger 
X Can we put sections in this order left to right; ABOUT, BARBERS, SERVICES, GALLERY, CONTACT, BOOK NOW
X Can we make font color for BOOK NOW red so it stands out

FOOTER:
X Can we update phone number to 805-497-3400

ABOUT:
X Can we update text with attached copy. I made less wordy, do you think reads too “cheesy”
X Can we make font size touch larger
X Can we move “about” text box down to lower third of screen so that “double edge” in background photo visible. Not sure if moving down would make look weird, Or is there a way to make boxes around text within ea. section more “see through”? 

BARBERS:
- Can we put all barber boxes on same row, either horizontal, or running vertical (on right side of screen, covering my hand in photo down towards towel on guest’s head. Not sure if that would look weird on the screen, or if we could make boxes more “see through”. 

CONTACT:
X Can we move text box to left so “always tight” in background photo visible
X Can we update phone number to 805-497-3400
- Can we make box smaller while making font size for text slightly larger

SERVICES:
X Can we make font touch larger and increase row space between services 
- Can we decrease space/margins on sides of text, making box narrower 
X Can we replace background photo with shop interior photo (going to text you new photo)

I’m excited, site’s looking dope! Let me now if you have ques. regarding my notes and when good to touch base.
